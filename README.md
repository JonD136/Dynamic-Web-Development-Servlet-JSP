# Dynamic Web Development Servlet JSP

All these projects were done in <b>Netbeans</b>.

Tasks were to utilize <b>CSV</b> files and/or use the <b>database</b> to output information on the html page.

There's a folder called "<b>CVS files</b>" 

They help with some of these projects.

<b> DATABASE INFO: </b>

I used XAMPP that when installed, it allows me to start running Apache & MySQL.

Once both are running, on MySQL I click on "Admin" which will bring me to "localhost/phpmyadmin/"

Here i can create tables to work out my projects.
