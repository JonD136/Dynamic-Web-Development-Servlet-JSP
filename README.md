All these projects were done in <b>Netbeans</b>.

Tasks were to utilize <b>CSV</b> files and/or use the <b>database</b> to output information on the html page.

There's a folder called "<b>CVS files</b>" 

They help with some of these projects.

I used XAMPP that when installed, it allows me to start running Apache & MySQL.

Once both are running, on MySQL I click on "Admin" which will bring me to "localhost/phpmyadmin/"

Here i can create tables to work out my projects.

<b><u>For MAC:</b>

1. Click on "Manage Servers" tab
2. Have "Apache Web Server" and "MySQL Database" Running
3. Click to "Welcome" tab
4. Go to "localhost/phpmyadmin/"
